 A Comparative Analysis for Detecting Women's Harassment in Bangla Social Media Texts Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

### Description
In this study, I address the pressing concern of social media abuse against women by harnessing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With the exponential growth of social networks, the accessibility of online communication has brought about an alarming surge in abusive content. My objective is to utilize NLP to identify abusive Bangla text and contribute to its prevention. I meticulously outline a methodology spanning data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation. Through a dataset of 5,023 Bangla text samples manually categorized as positive or negative instances, I curate and refine the data. Employing TF-IDF for machine learning and word embedding for deep learning, including CNN, LSTM, and BERT, I ascertain their effectiveness in accurately classifying abuse. Extensive evaluation metrics encompassing accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices underscore my models' efficiency. Multinomial Naive Bayes with Trigram extraction achieves a remarkable 97.81% accuracy, complementing deep learning models' performanceâ€”CNN at 94.13% and LSTM at 94.53%. This study exemplifies NLP's potential in combating online abuse, acknowledging the evolving nature of the challenge and emphasizing continued research and adaptation for a safer digital environment
